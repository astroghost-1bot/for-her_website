        #1 Like I Knew You Before 16/09/2025
    </div>
    <div class="poem-text">
        I met you today, yet it feels so strange,
        Like time had folded, with nothing to change.
        Your smile was new, your laugh was too,
        But my heart kept whispering, ‚ÄúI know you.‚Äù

        The world called it chance, a moment, a start,
        But it settled so quickly, deep in my heart.
        Strangers don‚Äôt feel this easy, this right,
        Yet here you are, shining so bright.

        It wasn‚Äôt just meeting, it felt like a sign,
        As if our stories had quietly aligned.
        Every glance carried something more,
        Like a door I‚Äôd walked through once before.

        So I‚Äôll say it simply, no grand disguise,
        There‚Äôs something special I see in your eyes.
        We met today, but I just can‚Äôt ignore,
        It feels like I‚Äôve known you forever, and more

    <div class="poem-text">
        On weary days when my soul feels torn,
        your smile becomes my gentle dawn.
        Oh goddess, what gift, what fate, what plan,
        to let me worship where love began.

        I am no king, no saint, no fire,
        just a heart that beats with quiet desire.
        Yet mercy was written by heaven above,
        when it sent me you ‚Äî my temple of love.

        So let me bow, not in despair,
        but in surrender, true and rare.
        I am not only in love with you,
        I am devoted, completely, through.

    <div class="poem-text">
        Even in silence, I hear your song,
        A gentle rhythm that pulls me along.
        Through darkest nights, your light will stay,
        Guiding my heart in its fragile way.

        The world may fade, its colors dim,
        But love still burns ‚Äî it lives within.
        Your smile ignites the skies above,
        A timeless spark, eternal love.

        Each word you speak feels carved in gold,
        A story written, yet never old.
        Your laughter paints the air so bright,
        It turns my shadows into light.

        So let the stars bear witness true,
        That every dream begins with you.
        For in my heart, there‚Äôs only one‚Äî
        My moon, my dawn, my endless sun.

    <div class="poem-text">
        Your kindness feels like morning light,
        Breaking through my longest night.
        With every smile, the shadows fade,
        A brighter world is gently made.

        You speak with warmth, so soft, so true,
        And paint my skies in softer blue.
        Where doubt once lived, now hope can stay,
        Because you choose to light my way.

        Even the silence feels alive,
        When your gentle care arrives.
        Your presence heals, your laughter sings,
        You turn the gray to golden springs.

        To call you sweet would still fall short,
        No words could hold the love you brought.
        A heart like yours, so rare to see,
        Has changed the way the world feels to me

        #5 How Cute She Is ‚ù§ 19/09/2025
    </div>
    <div class="poem-text">
        The way you smile, so pure, so small,
        It feels like sunshine warms us all.
        Your laugh‚Äôs a spark, so soft, so sweet,
        It makes the moment feel complete.

        Your eyes hold mischief, bright and shy,
        Like little stars across the sky.
        One playful glance, the world turns new,
        And joy just follows all you do.

        The way you pout when things go wrong,
        Could melt the hardest hearts along.
        Even your silence feels so near,
        Like sweetest music I can hear.

        So cute, so rare, a gentle glow,
        Much more than words could ever show.
        You make the dullest hours shine,
        I‚Äôm lucky that your light is mine.

    <div class="poem-text">
        Padmanabha, your leela,
        how can I put it into words?
        On a path once filled with shadows,
        you placed her as the light I never expected.

        She became the answer to prayers,
        hidden within your smile,
        a form you chose to send my way,
        a soul that now rests in my heart.

        You lifted my burdens,
        by placing her hand into mine,
        what once felt empty and hollow,
        you filled with the warmth of her voice, her presence.

        Padmanabha, your leela,
        how can I ever express?
        With just a single turn of your divine play,
        you brought me closer to her.

        The blessing of my life ‚ù§ üéÄ 23/09/25
    </div>
    <div class="poem-text">
        The way she spoke, the way her eyes lit up
        I adored every single glance of hers.
        I never knew the Lord had such mercy on me,
        To bless my life with her presence.

        I love her, I adore her, I cherish her.
        A million lines of praise could be written,
        Yet none could ever match her beauty.
        She is truly one in a million.

        Her eyes‚Äîthey sparkle like stars.
        Her smile soft, playful, and mischievous.
        How can words ever capture her?
        My feelings shine brighter each passing day.

        I think of her every moment,
        Wake with her name in my heart,
        And fall asleep with her in my thoughts.
        I have become hers, entirely.
        I love her.

        The way I long to treat her,
        The way I wish to wipe away every sorrow,
        The way I want to stand by her forever
        No love could ever compare.

        She Danced With the Grace of Her 23/09/2025
    </div>
    <div class="poem-text">
        She danced with the grace of her, lamps flickered into flame,
        Every beat seemed to whisper out her name.
        Crowds were lost in color, but my eyes knew only one,
        Her smile turned the night into a rising sun.

        She danced with the grace of her, bangles chimed like prayer,
        Even the stars above leaned down just to stare.
        The world was dressed in rhythm, the air was filled with song,
        But in her sway I found the place where I belong.

        She danced with the grace of her, each step a secret call,
        A language made of glances no one else could know at all.
        In the lantern glow she moved, a festival made flesh,
        My heart kept time with hers, two rhythms softly mesh.

        She danced with the grace of her, and all I could do was see,
        That every Navratri flame was burning just for me.
        Not a goddess, not a dream, but the truest girl alive,
        And in her dance I knew ‚Äî my love will never die.

        HER EYES 25/09/25
    </div>
    <div class="poem-text">
        Her eyes
        Vast galaxies spinning in calm midnight skies,
        Each glance a silent promise
        That makes the universe pause and listen.
        In their quiet depths,
        Starlight dances and secrets are kept,
        Mysteries untold, gentle and wise,
        A world awakened every time she blinks.
        
        They hold the glow of distant dawns
        And the hush of twilight‚Äôs peace,
        Soft as the whisper of spring rain,
        Warm as the hope only love can release.
        
        Sometimes they glimmer with laughter,
        Other times, shimmer with dreams,
        Two constellations set afloat
        On the endless ocean of her being.
        
        To look in her eyes is to remember wonder
        To believe in beauty,
        To lose and find oneself,
        Again and again, in her gaze.

    <div class="poem-title">
        HER BEAUTIFUL FACE üéÄ
    </div>
    <div class="poem-text">
        Her face is the first dawn I‚Äôve ever trusted,
        a quiet light that falls softly,
        yet reaches every hidden part of me.
        Her eyes are not just eyes‚Äî
        they are whole worlds,
        where I lose myself and still find my way back
        better than before.

        Her smile‚Äî
        ah, her smile‚Äî
        it is the kind of music no instrument can play,
        a melody born only in the heart.
        It doesn‚Äôt just brighten her face,
        it lifts the weight of entire days off mine.

        When I look at her,
        I don‚Äôt see perfection carved by the world‚Äôs standards.
        I see something rarer,
        a harmony of grace and kindness
        woven so seamlessly together
        that beauty becomes more than appearance‚Äî
        it becomes a presence.

        Her face is not fleeting charm.
        It is a promise,
        that even in storms,
        there will be light.
        It is a reminder
        that God writes poetry too,
        sometimes in the curve of a cheek,
        sometimes in the shimmer of a gaze,
        and sometimes, if you are blessed,
        in the face of the one you love.
